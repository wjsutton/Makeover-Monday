What's Makeover Monday? Find out here: [https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk)

This week's Makeover Monday involved Major League Baseball homerun hitters from 1985 to 2016.

The project can be found here: [https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/)

Twitter had been alive with animated bar charts and while opinions were up in the air as to whether this a good data viz or not, they certainly attract plenty of attention and keep users engaged, for example:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New project:<br> <br>A ‚ÄúBar Chart Race‚Äù animation showing the changing ranks of the 10 biggest cities in the world since 1500.<br><br>Fascinating to watch giant cities vanish after falling in conquests, and amazing that three UK cities were in the top 8 in the late 1800s. <a href="https://t.co/KglMZbYobr">pic.twitter.com/KglMZbYobr</a></p>&mdash; John Burn-Murdoch (@jburnmurdoch) <a href="https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1107552367795412992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 18, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

So I decided to work out how to create my own. 

## Workflow <a name = "workflow"></a>
These instructions will recreate an animated bar chart race from scratch using the MLB data set. You can either use the steps below or run the script [mlb_chart_build.R](https://github.com/wjsutton/Makeover-Monday/blob/master/2019w19/mlb_chart_build.R) locally 

### Prerequisites

For this visualisation you will need R installed and the require packages to run the script [mlb_chart_build.R](https://github.com/wjsutton/Makeover-Monday/blob/master/2019w19/mlb_chart_build.R) 

Packages can be installed by
```
install.packages(c("gganimate","janitor","gifski","dplyr","zoo"), dependencies = TRUE)
```
Verify these have installed correctly with 
```
library(gganimate)
library(janitor)
library(gifski)
library(dplyr)
library(zoo)
```

### Loading the Data

The dataset is available as a csv online, so we don't need to download it locally, we can read the data in to the dataframe "df" using read.csv()
```
df <- read.csv("https://query.data.world/s/u3stzqkmghigjrrzio7vyfzch4gqe5", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

### TO DO: Transforming the Data

To make an animated bar chart we will need to alter our data "df" to go from this: 

To this:

Where the columns blah will be used for this and that

### TO DO: Building the Chart

Lastly save the gif with anim_save()

```
anim_save("mlb_home_run_bar_chart_race.gif", anim)
```

And tada, one bar chart race created
